# News and Stock Data Analysis Project

This project is designed to fetch, process, and analyse news and stock market data, with the goal of extracting key information that can influence market trends. The project utilises Python for data fetching and processing, and Node.js for advanced analytics using GPT models.

-   `npm` (Node package manager)
-   Required Node.js packages can be installed using `package.json`

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://your-repo-url.git
    cd your-repo
    ```

2. **Install Python dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Install Node.js dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. **Set up environment variables:**

    Create a `.env` file in the `config/` directory or the root directory with the following variables:

    ```plaintext
    USERNAME=your_aylien_username
    PASSWORD=your_aylien_password
    APP_ID=your_aylien_app_id
    ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY=your_alpha_vantage_api_key
    ALPHA_VANTAGE_BASE_URL=https://www.alphavantage.co/query

    GPTC_API_KEY=your_gptc_api_key
    GPTD_API_KEY=your_gptd_api_key
    DAILY_PATH=path_to_daily_data_file
    WEEKLY_PATH=path_to_weekly_data_file
    MONTHLY_PATH=path_to_monthly_data_file
    NEWS_PATH=path_to_news_data_file
    PLANNER_PATH=path_to_output_planner_file
    ```

## Usage

### Fetching News Data

The news fetching process is handled by the `news_fetch` module in Python.

-   To fetch and save news data:

    ```bash
    python src/news_fetch/fetch.py
    ```

-   To sort and filter the fetched news data:
    ```bash
    python src/news_fetch/sort.py
    ```

### Fetching Stock Data

The stock fetching process is handled by the `stock_fetch` module in Python.

-   To fetch daily, weekly, and monthly stock data:

    ```bash
    python src/stock_fetch/fetch.py
    ```

-   To organise and reverse the time series data:
    ```bash
    python src/stock_fetch/organise.py
    ```

### Running the Planner

The planner orchestrates the entire process and integrates the results. It is written in Node.js.

-   To create and execute the planner:
    ```bash
    node src/planner/index.js
    ```

### Orchestrating the Complete Process

The orchestration program coordinates the various adaptors and ensures the data flows through each stage correctly.

-   To run the orchestration program:
    ```bash
    node src/orchestration/index.js
    ```

## Testing

Unit tests for each module are located in the `tests/` directory. You can run the tests using the following commands:

-   **Python tests:**

    ```bash
    pytest tests/news_fetch
    pytest tests/stock_fetch
    ```

-   **Node.js tests:**
    ```bash
    npm test
    ```
