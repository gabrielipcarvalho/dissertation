### 4.4 Data Sources and Collection Methods

This section outlines the data sources and collection methods used in this research. The study uses several types of data to ensure comprehensive analysis and robust model training. These include historical stock market data, financial news articles, and sentiment data. The datasets provide a foundation for evaluating the feasibility of fine-tuning GPT models for financial predictive analytics.

#### 4.4.1 Historical Stock Market Data

Historical stock market data is necessary for training and validating the predictive models. This data includes daily closing prices, trading volumes, and other relevant financial metrics over an extended period. The sources for this data are financial databases such as Yahoo Finance, Bloomberg, and Reuters. These databases are selected due to their extensive coverage and reliability. The data is downloaded in a structured format (e.g., CSV or JSON) and includes a range of stock indices and individual stocks to ensure a broad representation of market conditions (Wang & Wang, 2008; Otero & Kampouridis, 2014).

The data acquisition process involves accessing APIs provided by these financial databases. The APIs facilitate the automated extraction of historical stock prices and trading volumes. The data is then cleaned and normalised to ensure consistency. This includes adjusting for stock splits, dividends, and other corporate actions (Danylov, Huskova, Bidyuk, & Jirov, 2019). The cleaned data is stored in a database to support model training and evaluation (Bagci, 2021).

#### 4.4.2 Financial News Articles

Financial news articles provide context and sentiment information, which are critical for understanding market reactions to events. These articles are sourced from financial news platforms including Reuters, Financial Times, Bloomberg, and CNBC. The articles cover topics such as market analyses, economic reports, corporate earnings, and geopolitical events. The collection process involves automated scraping using APIs provided by these platforms. The text data is then processed and stored in a format suitable for natural language processing tasks (Wang & Wang, 2008; Otero & Kampouridis, 2014).

The scraping process involves accessing the APIs to collect articles published over a specific period. The articles are then parsed to extract relevant content, including headlines, body text, and publication dates. The text data is preprocessed to remove irrelevant information such as advertisements and navigation links. Tokenisation and lemmatisation are applied to standardise the text for further analysis. The processed data is stored in a database, ready for sentiment analysis and model training (Bagci, 2021; Danylov et al., 2019).

#### 4.4.3 Sentiment Data

Sentiment data is derived from financial news articles using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. These techniques analyse the textual content to determine the overall sentiment, classifying it as positive, negative, or neutral. In this research, a dedicated instance of the GPT model performs the sentiment analysis. The GPT model is fine-tuned through each iteration to improve its accuracy in sentiment classification (Fatouros et al., 2023).

The process begins with the collection of financial news articles, which are then fed into the GPT model. The model processes the text to identify sentiment indicators and generates sentiment scores for each article. These scores reflect the tone and sentiment conveyed in the text, categorising the content into positive, negative, or neutral classes (Pompiliu Cristescu et al., 2022).

To ensure the robustness of the sentiment analysis, the model undergoes iterative fine-tuning. This involves training the model on a dataset of labelled financial news articles, adjusting the model parameters to enhance its ability to accurately classify sentiment. Over time, the model's performance improves, making its sentiment predictions more reliable (Mudinas et al., 2018).

The sentiment scores generated by the GPT model are aggregated over time to create a sentiment index. This index provides a temporal view of market sentiment, reflecting how news sentiment trends evolve. The sentiment index is used as an input feature for the predictive models, helping to correlate news sentiment with stock market movements (Danylov et al., 2019).

By using a fine-tuned GPT model for sentiment analysis, the research ensures that the sentiment data is precise and relevant. This approach enhances the understanding of market reactions to news events and improves the predictive capabilities of the models. The sentiment analysis process is integral to capturing the complex relationships between news sentiment and market behaviour, providing valuable insights for financial predictive analytics (Bagci, 2021).

#### 4.4.4 Data Collection Procedures

The data collection procedures involve several steps to ensure data quality and relevance:

1. **Data Acquisition**: Historical stock data is obtained directly from financial databases using API access. This involves connecting to APIs provided by databases such as Yahoo Finance, Bloomberg, and Reuters to download historical stock prices, trading volumes, and other relevant metrics (Bagci, 2021). Financial news articles are collected using web scraping techniques or API endpoints provided by news platforms like Reuters, Financial Times, Bloomberg, and CNBC. The collected articles cover a wide range of financial topics, including market analyses, economic reports, corporate earnings, and geopolitical events. Sentiment data is generated by processing the collected articles through a fine-tuned GPT model designed for sentiment analysis. This model classifies the sentiment of each article as positive, negative, or neutral, providing a sentiment score for further analysis (Fatouros et al., 2023).

2. **Data Preprocessing**: The raw data undergoes preprocessing to clean and normalise it, ensuring consistency and accuracy. For financial data, this process includes handling missing values by using methods such as imputation or deletion, removing duplicates to prevent data redundancy, and adjusting for stock splits and dividends to maintain historical accuracy (Danylov et al., 2019). For textual data, preprocessing involves several steps: tokenisation, which splits the text into individual words or tokens; stop word removal, which eliminates common words that do not contribute to the analysis (e.g., 'and', 'the'); and lemmatisation, which reduces words to their base or root form (Pompiliu Cristescu et al., 2022). This preprocessing ensures that the textual data is in a standardised format, making it suitable for further analysis by the sentiment model and other NLP tools (Mudinas et al., 2018).

3. **Data Integration**: The different datasets are integrated to form a comprehensive dataset. Historical stock prices are aligned with the corresponding news articles and sentiment scores based on their timestamps. This alignment ensures that each stock price record is associated with relevant news sentiment, capturing the temporal relationship between market movements and news events (Mudinas et al., 2018). The integration process involves merging the datasets on common attributes such as date and time, ensuring that the models receive a unified view of the data. This combined dataset provides a holistic view of the market, incorporating both quantitative market data and qualitative sentiment information, which is crucial for accurate predictive analytics (Fatouros et al., 2023).

4. **Data Storage**: The processed and integrated data is stored in a structured format suitable for model training. Databases such as MySQL are used to store large volumes of data efficiently, providing robust storage solutions that support high-performance data retrieval and manipulation (Danylov et al., 2019). The data storage design facilitates easy access and retrieval for training and evaluation purposes. Each record in the database is indexed by key attributes such as date, stock symbol, and sentiment score, ensuring quick and efficient querying. This organisation allows for the seamless extraction of data needed for model training, backtesting, and performance evaluation, supporting the iterative process of model development and refinement (Bagci, 2021).

By employing these data sources and collection methods, the research ensures a robust and comprehensive dataset for training and evaluating the GPT models. This approach captures the complex relationships between market movements and external factors, enhancing the predictive capabilities of the models. The systematic acquisition, preprocessing, integration, and storage of data are critical to maintaining data quality and relevance, enabling the development of accurate and reliable predictive models for financial analytics (Pompiliu Cristescu et al., 2022).

### 4.5 Evaluation Metrics

Evaluation metrics are essential for assessing the effectiveness and accuracy of the financial predictive analytics system developed in this research. These metrics are crucial in evaluating the performance of the fine-tuned GPT models and the overall system. They provide quantifiable data that support the conclusions drawn from the research and help in understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the applied methodologies.

#### Predictive Accuracy

1. **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: This metric measures the average of the absolute differences between predicted values and actual values. It is a straightforward assessment of prediction accuracy. A lower MAE value indicates higher accuracy. This metric is useful for comparing the accuracy of predictions among different models or system configurations. It provides a clear indication of average error magnitude without considering the direction of the errors (Altan & Karasu, 2019).

2. **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: RMSE is calculated as the square root of the average of the squared differences between predicted and actual values. This metric emphasises larger errors more than smaller ones, which makes it particularly relevant for financial data where large prediction errors can have significant implications (Altan & Karasu, 2019). RMSE is a standard measure to express the average error rate and helps in identifying cases with substantial discrepancies between predicted and actual outcomes (Santamaria, 2012).

3. **R-squared (R²)**: R-squared measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. This metric provides an insight into how well the data points fit a statistical model – a model with an R² close to 1 indicates that the model explains most of the variability of the response data around its mean. In the context of financial predictive analytics, a high R² value suggests that the model reliably captures the input-output relationship (Lee, Fan, Hung, & Ling, 2010).

4. **Directional Accuracy**: This metric assesses the model’s capability to predict the correct direction of market movements, such as price increases or decreases. Directional accuracy is calculated as the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions made. This metric is particularly important in the financial sector where the correct prediction of the trend direction is more crucial than the exact value of financial indicators. It helps in evaluating the model’s utility in real-world trading scenarios where the correct direction of price movement often matters more than the precise price levels (Bao, Tao, & Fu, 2015).

These evaluation metrics together provide a comprehensive overview of the model performance in the financial predictive analytics tasks. By applying these metrics systematically, the research aims to demonstrate the robustness and reliability of the predictive models, ensuring that the findings are grounded in empirical evidence and quantitative evaluation. The results derived from these metrics will guide further improvements and refinements to the system, contributing to the overall goal of enhancing predictive accuracy in financial analytics using GPT models.

#### Data Management Efficiency

1. **Data Processing Time**: This metric measures the time taken to preprocess, clean, and structure the raw financial data before it is fed into the models. Efficient data processing is crucial for real-time predictive analytics. Data processing includes tasks such as handling missing values, normalising data, and converting data formats. The faster the data processing, the quicker the models can be trained and predictions can be made. This efficiency is vital in financial markets where data changes rapidly and decisions must be made swiftly (Sharmila & Khanchana, 2017).

2. **Model Training Time**: The time required to train the GPT models on the financial datasets is measured to assess computational efficiency. Faster training times are preferable as they allow for more frequent updates to the models, which can incorporate the latest data and trends. Model training time is influenced by the size of the dataset, the complexity of the model, and the computational resources available. Measuring training time helps in identifying bottlenecks in the process and evaluating the feasibility of deploying these models in a production environment (Cai, Le-Khac, & Kechadi, 2012).

3. **Prediction Generation Time**: This metric evaluates the time taken by the models to generate predictions once the input data is provided. Quick prediction times are essential for practical applications in fast-paced financial markets. This metric is particularly important for applications such as high-frequency trading, where milliseconds can make a significant difference. Efficient prediction generation ensures that the system can respond promptly to new data and market conditions (Agarwal, Chinnasamy, & Kaushik, 2023).

4. **System Scalability**: The ability of the system to handle increasing amounts of data and more complex tasks without significant degradation in performance is assessed. Scalability is measured by monitoring system performance under different loads and data volumes. This includes assessing how the system manages concurrent processing tasks and its ability to maintain performance levels as data size and complexity grow. A scalable system ensures long-term viability and adaptability to evolving financial data environments (Zhang & Zhou, 2022).

#### Comparative Analysis

1. **Comparison with Traditional Models**: The performance of the fine-tuned GPT models is compared with traditional financial predictive models such as ARIMA, linear regression, and neural networks. Key metrics for this comparison include predictive accuracy, computational efficiency, and scalability. This comparison helps in understanding the relative strengths and weaknesses of the GPT models in relation to established methods. It provides a benchmark to assess whether the advanced capabilities of GPT models translate into tangible benefits in financial predictive tasks (Cai, Le-Khac, & Kechadi, 2012).

2. **Cost-Effectiveness**: The cost-effectiveness of using pre-trained GPT models versus developing bespoke AI solutions from scratch is evaluated. Factors considered include computational resource requirements, time investment for training and fine-tuning, and overall financial cost. Evaluating cost-effectiveness involves comparing the total expenses incurred in model development, training, and deployment against the benefits gained in terms of improved predictive performance and operational efficiency. This assessment helps in determining whether the adoption of GPT models offers a viable economic advantage over traditional approaches (Agarwal, Chinnasamy, & Kaushik, 2023).

By using these evaluation metrics, the research aims to provide a comprehensive assessment of the system's performance and feasibility. This approach ensures that the developed models are rigorously tested and validated, offering valuable insights into their practical applicability in financial predictive analytics. These metrics help in identifying areas where the models excel and aspects that require further refinement, guiding the development of more effective and efficient predictive analytics tools.
