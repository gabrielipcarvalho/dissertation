### 4.5 Evaluation Metrics

Evaluation metrics are critical for assessing the effectiveness and accuracy of the financial predictive analytics system developed in this research. The following metrics will be used to evaluate the performance of the fine-tuned GPT models and the overall system:

#### Predictive Accuracy

1. **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: This metric measures the average absolute differences between predicted values and actual values. It provides a straightforward assessment of prediction accuracy, with lower MAE values indicating higher accuracy.

2. **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: RMSE calculates the square root of the average squared differences between predicted and actual values. This metric gives more weight to larger errors, making it useful for identifying significant prediction inaccuracies.

3. **R-squared (RÂ²)**: R-squared indicates the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. It measures the overall fit of the model, with values closer to 1 indicating a better fit.

4. **Directional Accuracy**: This metric evaluates the model's ability to correctly predict the direction of market movements (e.g., whether stock prices will rise or fall). It is calculated as the proportion of correctly predicted directions out of the total predictions made.

#### Data Management Efficiency

1. **Data Processing Time**: This metric measures the time taken to preprocess, clean, and structure the raw financial data before it is fed into the models. Efficient data processing is crucial for real-time predictive analytics.

2. **Model Training Time**: The time required to train the GPT models on the financial datasets is measured to assess computational efficiency. Faster training times without compromising accuracy are preferable.

3. **Prediction Generation Time**: This metric evaluates the time taken by the models to generate predictions once the input data is provided. Quick prediction times are essential for practical applications in fast-paced financial markets.

4. **System Scalability**: The ability of the system to handle increasing amounts of data and more complex tasks without significant degradation in performance is assessed. Scalability is measured by monitoring system performance under different loads and data volumes.

#### Comparative Analysis

1. **Comparison with Traditional Models**: The performance of the fine-tuned GPT models is compared with traditional financial predictive models such as ARIMA, linear regression, and neural networks. Key metrics for this comparison include predictive accuracy, computational efficiency, and scalability.

2. **Cost-Effectiveness**: The cost-effectiveness of using pre-trained GPT models versus developing bespoke AI solutions from scratch is evaluated. Factors considered include computational resource requirements, time investment for training and fine-tuning, and overall financial cost.

By using these evaluation metrics, the research aims to provide a comprehensive assessment of the system's performance and feasibility. This approach ensures that the developed models are rigorously tested and validated, offering valuable insights into their practical applicability in financial predictive analytics.
