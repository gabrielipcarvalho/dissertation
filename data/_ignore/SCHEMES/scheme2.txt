->>> Expand on the section bellow:

{{{

}}}

Write about double of what is written already.
- Use British English, British Spelling, British preferred choice of words, British expression, British preferred syntax and semantics.
- Don't use literature words like "paramount", "pivotal" or anything clever.
- Be direct and objective. Avoid adverbs and adjectives entirely if possible.
- DON'T USE ADJECTIVES AND ADVERBS!!!!!! Remove those if they are already in the text!!!
- Make sure you are being academic and scientific without making use of clever words. Be direct and to the point, the text must be informative, not pretty or clever.
- Avoid this sentence construction: "not only [this], but also [that]", instead, be direct and objective, use this sentence construction: "[this] and [that]", can you see the difference?
- Don't be arrogant, on the contrary, be humble and stick to the research, avoid to the extreme making this research sounding like a grand breakthrough or something deserving of a Nobel Prize. Be HUMBLE, stick to what it is scoped, don't overdo it.

The references must be real published articles in reputable journals. You CANNOT make them up, you really need to put effort into looking for and finding suitable references for that section. Them compile them in a complete APA referencing format.
Give me only the references for the specific section I provided you in this prompt specifically. Don't rewrite the text yet, just give me the references, I need to evaluate if they are appropriate.
